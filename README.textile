h4. URL Parameters

Parameters may be appended to the url set some initial state eg. @head/index.html?base_uri=http://node-01.example.com:9200@

* @dashboard@ experimental feature to open elasticsearch-head in a mode suitable for dashoboard / radiator. Accepts one parameter @dashboard=cluster@

h4. Contributing

To contribute to elasticsearch-head you will need the following developer tools

# git and a "github":https://github.com/ account
# "node ( including npm )":http://nodejs.org/download
# "grunt-cli":http://gruntjs.com/getting-started

Then

# create a fork of elasticsearch-head on github
# clone your fork to your machine
# @cd elasticsearch-head@
# @npm install@ # downloads node dev dependencies
# @grunt default watch@ # builds the distribution files, then watches the src directory for changes

Changes to both dist and src directories *must* be committed, to allow people to run head without running dev tools
and folllow existing dev patterns, such as indenting with tabs
